      Cee don't be on the road too tough<br />
      But I still cut through with the local thugs (thugs)<br />
      Could've ran off the plug<br />
      But I kept it real and I showed him love (showed him love)<br />
      Lil' bro got the poker tucked<br />
      Where we grow up, it's so corrupt<br />
      Fans see me on the block, go nuts<br />
      I'm not in my bag, I'm loadin' loadin'<br />
      Back then it was hand to hand<br />
      Nowadays I don't have no involvement<br />
      In the trap, I stay on my own<br />
      I'm home alone, Macaulay Culkin<br />
      WhyJay no commented it<br />
      It's complicated 'cause the case still open<br />
      The boys in blue tryna find them clues<br />
      In the station, problem solvin' (solvin')<br />
      Bro just jumped out the ride<br />
      With a mask on face like he dodgin' COVID (bap)<br />
      Jumped off the porch and went my own way<br />
      No way, I don't owe no olders (no way)<br />
      Free all the guys and rest in peace<br />
      To all of the fallen soldiers<br />
      The world full up of impactive distractions<br />
      So we all lose focus (haha)<br />
      I think out loud, what comes out my mouth<br />
      I can't control it<br />
      "Live Yours" on the chain, I'm so lit<br />
      Soon come out with the custom clothin'<br />
      Fuck sake, you must be jokin'?<br />
      CIDs outside of the cut patrollin'<br />
      How did they know bout the ins and outs?<br />
      Somebody must have told them<br />
      Cee don't be on the road too tough<br />
      But I still cut through with the local thugs (thugs)<br />

      Cee don't do no field, I trap<br />
      Say, "Yo" to the local cat (yo)<br />
      See me on the road all black<br />
      My foot on the gas and I won't fall back<br />
      Bro been in jail and he won't go back<br />
      I fucked bare hoes and it ain't all that<br />
      I'm missin' their call and I won't phone back<br />
      It's time that I find me a wife<br />
      More time I don't have no type<br />
      But I wouldn't mind me a Liyah Mai (okay, okay)<br />
      Treat her right I try (alright, alright)<br />
      Finer things in life I'd buy (okay, okay)<br />
      Wanna wine and dine? That's fine<br />
      If we go uptown gotta hold that (whoosh, whoosh)<br />
      Wanna fly Dubai tonight?<br />
      Lastminute.com, I'll book that flight<br />
      Cee don't be on the road too tough<br />
